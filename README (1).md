Graphical User Interface (GUI) based To-Do List application with Tkinter and SQlite3 libraries in Python.
To-Do List is a great way to keep track of the things we need to do or things we would like to do, arranged in order of priority.
To build the application we need to import the necessary modules and other several steps.
Step 1: Import modules required for this project.
Step2:  We will then define some functions necessary to execute the application.
Step3: We will then create a main window for the application.
Step4:We add a database to the application to store the data.
Step5: We add the necessary widgets to the application and apply the event triggers.
Step6: Calling the functions in the main function of the application.
